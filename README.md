# DataPipeline
Create you own data pipeline using github actions . You start by extracting the data from a source (e.g., CSV, API, database). Then, you transform the data (e.g., data cleaning, normalization). Finally, you load the data into a target destination (e.g., database, data warehouse).

GitHub Actions help you automate your software development workflows in the same place you store code and collaborate on pull requests and issues. You can write individual tasks, called actions, and combine them to create a custom workflow. Workflows are custom automated processes that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any code project on GitHub.

With GitHub Actions you can build end-to-end continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) capabilities directly in your repository.

It might not be helpful for your personal project but, it will be very helpful in a organization having multipe layers.
