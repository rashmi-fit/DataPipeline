# DataPipeline
Create you own data pipeline using github actions . You start by extracting the data from a source (e.g., CSV, API, database). Then, you transform the data (e.g., data cleaning, normalization). Finally, you load the data into a target destination (e.g., database, data warehouse).

GitHub Actions is made by and for developers, so you don’t need dedicated resources to set up and maintain your pipeline. There’s no need to manually configure and set up CI/CD. You don’t have to set up webhooks, you don’t have to buy hardware, reserve some instances out there, keep them up to date, do security patches, or spool down idle machines. You just drop one file in your repo, and it works.
